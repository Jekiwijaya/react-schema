# React Schema

## Installation
yarn
```
yarn add @traveloka/react-schema-form
```

```
npm i @traveloka/react-schema-form --save
```

## Motivation
Form is common in any application. The final result of form is data. This library would separate the UI and Form logic by giving basic API to Field Component. The flow how to get the data, would be the responsible of the Field Component.
